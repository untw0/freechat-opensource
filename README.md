## About the Project

This project aims to provide a personal chat for you and your friends. I use it to host on onion networks, enabling private and secure conversations while preventing potential issues with conventional communication platforms.

I would like to make it clear that this is an open-source project, available for anyone to use as they see fit. However, I am not responsible for any improper or illegal use of the software. The responsibility for its use lies solely with the user.

If you wish to contribute to the project or have any questions, feel free to contact me on Discord: `@untw0` :D
